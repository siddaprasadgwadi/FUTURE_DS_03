# 🎓 College Event Feedback Analysis – Internship Project (Task 3)

✨ Use **data science to improve campus life!**  
This project demonstrates how student feedback from college events (tech fests, workshops, seminars, cultural activities) can be analyzed to extract meaningful insights.

## 🔍 Project Overview  
Events usually collect student feedback, but often the data is left unused.  
In this task, we apply **Data Science & Analytics techniques** to:  
- Understand **overall satisfaction levels**  
- Identify **top-performing areas** and **areas for improvement**  
- Compare **course-wise ratings**  
- Use **NLP sentiment analysis** on text comments  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and prepare feedback dataset (CSV exported from Google Forms)  
- Analyze **ratings (1–5 scale)**  
- Perform **sentiment analysis** on comments (positive, neutral, negative)  
- Visualize trends with **charts & heatmaps**  
- Suggest **data-driven recommendations** for improvement

## 🧠 Skills You’ll Gain  
- Data Cleaning with **pandas**  
- Visualization using **matplotlib & seaborn**  
- Text Analysis with **TextBlob / VADER (NLP)**  
- Generating **word clouds** for comments  
- Writing **insightful reports** for stakeholders
